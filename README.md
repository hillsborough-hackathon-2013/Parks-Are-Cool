Parks-Are-Cool
==============

The Problem (Why):
    Too few people go to Hillsborough County parks.  Even fewer people appreciate what surrounds them when they are there.

The Solution (What):
    A tool for educators (teachers) and parents to learn about their local parks - ecology, soil, flora, fauna, trails, etc. - and create a report depicting a map of the park, the locations they wish to visit and the details of what they will see in their chosen topics of interest.  A variation of the report will be in the "scavenger hunt" format to give students more experience in nature's classroom.  The educators will bring the students who will in turn bring their parents and spread the appreciation for this valuable resource - our parks.
